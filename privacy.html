<h2>1. Our commitment to Privacy</h2>
<p>At <strong>AppBelieve Studio</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications and related services published under the AppBelieve Studio developer account on Google Play.</p>
<p>We believe transparency builds trust — that’s why we want you to clearly understand what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
<p>Our apps may include features powered by trusted third-party services such as Firebase, Google Analytics for Firebase (GA4), Google AdMob, and Google Ads, which help us improve performance, deliver personalized experiences, and support the continued development of free apps.</p>
<p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or phone number) unless explicitly provided by you for specific purposes (e.g., contacting support). All analytics and advertising data are processed in compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, and other regional laws.</p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is a core part of how we design and maintain our products.</p>

<h2>2. Personal Data We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect limited types of information to ensure our apps work properly, display relevant ads, and help us understand how users interact with our products. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable or sensitive data such as passwords, precise location, contacts, or financial information.</p>

<h3>2.1. Data Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>When you use our apps, certain data may be collected automatically through third-party services such as Firebase, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google AdMob, and Google Ads. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device information (model, OS version, language, country)</li>
<li>App version and usage statistics</li>
<li>Anonymous identifiers (Advertising ID, Instance ID, or other non-personal identifiers)</li>
<li>Crash logs and diagnostic data</li>
<li>General location (country or region level only — not GPS)</li>
<li>Interaction data (e.g., app screens viewed, session duration)</li>
<li>Temporary cached images used for wallpaper display, which are never uploaded or shared externally.</li>
<li>Media Access (Photos, Videos, Audio): The app may request access to photos or media files stored on your device to allow setting wallpapers or displaying images. These files are never uploaded, shared, or transmitted outside your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information helps us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor performance and stability</li>
<li>Improve features and fix bugs</li>
<li>Deliver non-personalized or personalized ads (depending on user consent and device settings)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2. Data You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
<p>If you contact us (for example, via email or feedback form), we may collect the information you choose to provide, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name (if included)</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Message content</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this data only for responding to your inquiry or providing technical support.</p>

<h3>2.3. Third-Party SDKs and Services</h3>
<p>Our apps may use third-party SDKs that process limited technical data in accordance with their own privacy policies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase (analytics, crash reporting): <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
<li>Google Analytics 4 (GA4): <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
<li>Google AdMob & Google Ads (advertising): <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These services may use cookies or similar technologies to serve ads and collect aggregate analytics data. AppBelieve Studio does not have access to or control over this data beyond what these platforms make available to developers in anonymized reports. All SDKs are integrated in compliance with Google Play’s Families and Data Safety policies.</p>

<h2>3. How Personal Data is Used</h2>
<p>We use the collected information only for legitimate purposes related to app functionality, improvement, and compliance. All data is processed in a secure and aggregated manner — we do not attempt to identify any individual user.</p>

<h3>3.1. To Operate and Improve the App</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyze app usage and user behavior patterns using Firebase and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to improve performance, usability, and content relevance.</li>
<li>Identify and fix bugs, crashes, or compatibility issues through Firebase Crashlytics.</li>
<li>Measure overall engagement to enhance user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2. To Display Ads and Support Monetization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serve ads via Google AdMob and Google Ads SDKs to support the free use of our apps.</li>
<li>Depending on user consent and device settings, ads may be personalized or non-personalized.</li>
<li>AppBelieve Studio does not store or process personal advertising profiles — all ad targeting and consent handling are managed by Google’s systems.</li>
<li>Data such as the advertising ID or general location may be used to limit ad frequency, detect fraud, and measure ad performance.</li>
<li>We rely on Google’s consent APIs (User Messaging Platform / UMP SDK) for collecting ad consent in EEA regions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3. To Communicate with Users</h3>
<p>Respond to feedback, bug reports, or support requests sent via email or other contact channels. Use provided contact details solely for replying to your message — not for marketing or data sharing.</p>

<h3>3.4. To Ensure Compliance and Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Detect, prevent, or address potential security incidents, fraud, or policy violations.</li>
<li>Maintain compliance with Google Play Developer Policies, GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws.</li>
<li>We do not sell, rent, or trade user data with any external parties.</li>
<li>All processing activities are carried out in accordance with Google’s privacy frameworks and applicable data protection regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How Personal Data is Shared</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or trade user data to any third parties. Data collected through our apps is shared only in limited, lawful ways necessary to operate our services and comply with applicable policies.</p>

<h3>4.1. With Service Providers</h3>
<p>We may share limited, non-personally identifiable data with trusted third-party service providers who help us run our apps. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase (Google LLC) – analytics, crash reporting, and app performance.</li>
<li>Google Analytics 4 (GA4) – user interaction and event tracking.</li>
<li>Google AdMob / Google Ads – ad serving, fraud prevention, and campaign measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>All third-party services are bound by their own privacy and data protection policies and may collect or process data as independent controllers. You can learn more here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These services (such as Google AdMob, Google Ads, and their related domains like doubleclick.net) may periodically update their network endpoints to deliver, measure, or optimize ads. Any such connections are handled automatically by Google’s SDKs under their Privacy Policy and do not involve manual data sharing by AppBelieve Studio.</p>

<h3>4.2. For Legal Reasons</h3>
<p>We may disclose information when required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comply with legal obligations or government requests.</li>
<li>Protect the safety, rights, or property of users, the public, or AppBelieve Studio.</li>
<li>Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or security issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3. Aggregate and Anonymous Data</h3>
<p>We may use and share aggregated or anonymized data (which cannot identify you) for research, analytics, and improvement purposes. This helps us understand general usage trends and improve overall app quality without affecting individual privacy.</p>
<h2>5. How Personal Data is Retained and Secured</h2>
<p>We take privacy and data protection seriously. AppBelieve Studio applies appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect user information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>

<h3>5.1. Data Retention</h3>
<p>We do not store personal data on our own servers. All automatically collected data (analytics, crash logs, ads metrics) is processed and retained by Google Firebase, Google Analytics 4, and AdMob according to their respective retention policies.</p>
<p>If you contact us via email, your message may be retained only as long as necessary to resolve your request or provide support. Once no longer needed, data is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

<h3>5.2. Data Security</h3>
<p>We rely on trusted Google infrastructure and SDKs, which apply industry-standard encryption, secure transmission (HTTPS), and restricted access to protect user data. AppBelieve Studio employees and contractors (if any) do not have direct access to raw analytics or advertising identifiers — only aggregated reports.</p>
<p>We continuously review our apps to ensure no unintended data collection or exposure occurs. While no online service can guarantee absolute security, AppBelieve Studio strives to maintain the highest practical standards to safeguard user data within our technical capacity.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>You have control over how your information is used. Depending on your region, you may have the following rights:</p>

<h3>Access or Delete Data</h3>
<p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:dev.appbelieve@gmail.com">dev.appbelieve@gmail.com</a> to ask about any data we hold (for example, support emails) or request deletion. Because our app does not collect personal information directly, most data is handled by Google services like Firebase and AdMob.</p>

<h3>Right to Know Whether Data is Shared (CCPA)</h3>
<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), users have the right to know whether their personal data is sold or shared with third parties. We do not sell or share your personal information with any third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. If this changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h3>Opt-out of Personalized Ads</h3>
<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising or the sharing/sale of your personal data used for advertising purposes. We do not sell or share your personal information for marketing or data brokerage. However, some third-party services (such as Google AdMob or Firebase) may use data to personalize ads or measure performance.</p>
<p>You can disable these personalized ads anytime:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
<li>iOS: Settings → Privacy → Tracking → Disable “Allow Apps to Request to Track”</li>
<li>Manage preferences: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to make a specific opt-out request under privacy laws such as CCPA or VCDPA, please email us at <a href="mailto:dev.appbelieve@gmail.com">dev.appbelieve@gmail.com</a> with the subject line: <strong>Privacy Opt-Out Request – [App Name]</strong>.</p>

<h3>Opt-out of Data Sale or Sharing</h3>
<p>AppBelieve Studio does not sell or share your personal information. However, if you wish to opt out of any sharing for advertising or targeted ads, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:dev.appbelieve@gmail.com">dev.appbelieve@gmail.com</a> or adjust your settings at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Withdraw Consent</h3>
<p>If you previously gave permission for ads or analytics, you can change this in your device or app settings.</p>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:dev.appbelieve@gmail.com">dev.appbelieve@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Subject line: Privacy Request – [App Name]</p>
<p>We’ll respond as soon as possible, usually within 30 days.</p>

<h2>7. App Permissions</h2>
<p>Our app may request certain device permissions to enable its core features and support advertising or analytics services. These permissions are used only for their intended technical purposes. We do not use them to collect personal information or access your private content.</p>

<p>Specifically, the app may request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet and Network Access (INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE): required to load online content, display ads, and send anonymous analytics data through Google services.</li>
<li>Advertising Identifiers (com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID, ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID, ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION, ACCESS_ADSERVICES_TOPICS): used by Google Ads and AdMob to deliver and measure personalized or contextual advertising.</li>
<li>Billing Permission (com.android.vending.BILLING): enables secure in-app purchases or subscriptions via Google Play.</li>
<li>Wallpaper Access (SET_WALLPAPER): allows the app to set images as device wallpapers at the user’s request.</li>
<li>Storage Access (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): allows reading and saving wallpaper images for display only. The app does not access personal photos or files.</li>
<li>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS): optional permission that lets the app send notifications such as updates or reminders, only if the user grants consent.</li>
<li>Foreground and Wake Permissions (FOREGROUND_SERVICE, WAKE_LOCK): ensure that wallpaper or background processes can run smoothly without interruption.</li>
<li>Install Referrer Service (BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE): used by Google Play to measure installs and app performance metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storage and Media Access Clarification:</strong> When granted, the storage permission (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) may technically allow access to media files such as photos or videos stored on your device. However, our app only reads image files selected or displayed as wallpapers and does not access, scan, upload, or store any other personal media content such as your personal photos, videos, or audio recordings. No media data is ever transmitted off your device. All access remains local and limited strictly to the wallpaper functionality requested by the user.</p>

<p>AppBelieve Studio does not access, store, or share any personal data, files, photos, or location information from your device.</p>

<h2>8. California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), users who reside in California have specific rights regarding their personal information. Because AppBelieve Studio apps do not collect personal data directly, most information is processed by trusted third-party providers (e.g., Google Firebase, Google AdMob, Google Analytics 4).</p>

<p>As a California resident, you may have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know what personal information is collected and how it’s used.</li>

<li>Non-discrimination: exercising your CCPA rights will not result in any difference in app quality, pricing, or access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Opt Out of Data Sharing or Sale</h3>
<p>AppBelieve Studio respects your right to opt out of any data sharing or selling activities as defined under the VCDPA.

<p>If changes are material, we will notify users within the app (pop-up, in-app message, or website notice) before the new policy becomes effective. We encourage users to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of our apps after any modifications means you agree to the updated terms.</p>
