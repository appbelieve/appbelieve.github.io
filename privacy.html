    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>At <strong>AppBelieve Studio</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications and related services published under the AppBelieve Studio developer account on Google Play. Transparency builds trust — we want you to clearly understand what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
    <p>Our apps may include features powered by trusted third-party services such as Firebase, Google Analytics for Firebase (GA4), Google AdMob, and Google Ads, which help us improve performance, deliver personalized experiences, and support the continued development of free apps.</p>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or phone number) unless explicitly provided by you for specific purposes (e.g., contacting support). All analytics and advertising data are processed in compliance with applicable privacy regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other regional laws. Protecting your privacy is a core part of how we design and maintain our products.</p>
